08/14/2016 Goals
----------------
Upgrade to a professional quality project with code on pypi.

0.0.3
-----
Improve documentation language.

0.0.4
-----
Add testsuite.

Normal operation alters the file system, so I need to build and destroy testbeds.

The general testing scheme for a test is

    * setup a file tree
    * do some sequence of exile and pardon commands
    * check the result
    * cleanup
