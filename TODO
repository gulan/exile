08/14/2016 Goals
----------------
Upgrade to a professional quality project with code on pypi.

0.0.3
-----
Improve documentation language.

0.0.4
-----
Add testsuite.

Normal operation alters the file system, so I need to build and destroy testbeds.

The general testing scheme for a test is

    * setup a file tree
    * do some sequence of exile and pardon commands
    * check the result
    * cleanup

0.0.5
-----
Fix bug: empty .exile/project directory not removed

This wasn't really a bug before, as I designed the code to leave the
empty directory. I have since changed my mind. Now the empty directory
raises an error in the testsuite.

0.1.0
-----
Convert setup.py from distutils to setuptools

0.1.1
-----
Use path.XXX instead of os.path.XXX

0.1.2
-----
Migrate code to a package

0.1.3
-----
Code golf

0.2.0
-----
Convert invocation to use shell subcommands.

Where before I would do

    $ pardon abc

now I do

    $ exiler pardon abc
